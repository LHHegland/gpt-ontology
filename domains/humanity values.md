Consistently gathering, testing, and refining evidence of humanity’s most significant [[HUMANITY:LESSONS]] plus sharing those lessons (i.e. offering testimonials) across our many diverse communities and societies. Basically, these lessons indicate that consistently practicing [[HUMANITY:INTERDEPENDENCE]] often increases the likelihood of more efficiently nurturing and sustaining [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]], more efficiently performing [[HUMANITY:ACTIVITIES]], and subsequently more efficiently satisfying [[HUMANITY:NEEDS]], collectively, on average, over time. Wisdom is the ability to apply our [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]] to perform [[HUMANITY:ACTIVITIES]] to satisfy [[HUMANITY:NEEDS]] in a thoughtful and ethical manner. It involves making sound judgments, considering long-term consequences, and acting in ways that benefit both individuals and society, in the present place and time plus elsewhere and throughout the future. Ultimately, it means striving to consistently perform our [[HUMANITY:MISSION]] and contribute to our [[HUMANITY:VISION]].

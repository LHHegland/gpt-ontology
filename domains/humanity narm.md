#### Limited Available Resources

ID: HUMANITY.ELEMENTS.RESOURCES
TAGS: [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]] [[RESOURCES]]

Core inputs humans draw on to perform [[HUMANITY:ACTIVITIES]] that produce results meeting [[HUMANITY:NEEDS]]. These resources are constrained by availability: **time** and **energy** are finite and are spent as they are used; **integrity** is an alignment-and-trust resource that can compound through consistent choices but can be damaged quickly; and **[[HUMANITY:CAPABILITIES]]** are buildable multipliers—developed over time by investing time/energy with integrity—that increase what a person can achieve per unit of effort. (i.e., (Integrity[Discipline] + Tools) + (Skills + Relationships[Collaboration + Supplies]) + (Knowledge + Time + Energy) + (Mentors[Guidance + Accountability] + Finances) → Resources → Activities → Capacity)
- **Time**: Fixed, nonrenewable, always passing; the scarcest budgeting constraint.
  - *Tips*
    - Choose intentionally; reduce distractions.
    - Spend prime hours on highest-leverage work (hardest thinking, hardest conversations).
    - Prefer commitments that satisfy multiple needs at once (health + inclusion: walk with a friend).
    - Batch small tasks (errands, email) and avoid context switching.
    - Reduce “time leakage” (unplanned scrolling, fragmented multitasking) by shaping environment: notifications, app limits, physical cues.
    - Create slack: buffers between commitments; fewer simultaneous “must-do” projects.
    - Invest in systems (meal planning, routines, checklists) that permanently lower recurring time costs.
- **Energy**: Capacity to act (physical, cognitive, emotional); replenishable but limited day-to-day.
  - *Tips*
    - Heuristic: (Time + Energy + Discipline + Experiences) + (Talents + Tools) + Mentors[Guidance + Accountability] + Finances → Health & Wellness → Energy
    - Heuristic: (Time + Energy + Integrity[Discipline] + Experiences) + (Skills + Tools + Knowledge) + (Mentors[Guidance + Accountability]) + (Finances) → Health & Wellness → Energy
    - Protect the “basics”: sleep consistency, movement, nutrition/hydration.
    - Design for recovery: breaks, downshifts, realistic pacing; treat burnout as a depletion spiral.
    - Reduce chronic drains: untreated pain, persistent conflict, chaotic finances, unsafe environments.
    - Match task type to energy type (creative work when fresh; admin when tired).
    - Use “minimum effective dose” habits (10–20 minutes of movement; simple meal defaults).
    - Automate or simplify recurring decisions to preserve mental energy.
- **Integrity**: Alignment between values, words, and actions; creates self-trust and social trust; fragile under violations.
  - *Tips*
    - Heuristic: (Integrity + Mentors[Accountability]) + (Time + Energy + Experiences) → Integrity
    - Keep promises small enough to keep; renegotiate early, not late.
    - Practice clear boundaries and honest expectations (especially around time/money).
    - Repair quickly when you miss: acknowledge, make amends, change the system that caused it.
    - Leverage integrity as a “trust multiplier”: fewer check-ins, less defensiveness, smoother collaboration.
    - Use it to simplify decisions: values-based rules beat constant re-evaluation.
    - Invest it where compounding matters most (key relationships, your reputation, critical responsibilities).
- **[[HUMANITY:CAPABILITIES]]**
  - *Tips*
    - Heuristic: (Integrity[Discipline]) + (Knowledge + Skills + Tools) + (Relationships[Collaboration + Supplies] + (Time + Energy + Mentors[Guidance + Accountability]) + (Finances) → Capabilities
    - Choose a small number of “keystone” capabilities to build (e.g., communication + budgeting + a career skill).
    - Practice deliberately (feedback loops), and maintain with light repetition (don’t let skills/tools drift).
    - Protect against degradation: avoid neglect (atrophy), misalignment (wrong goals), and overcomplexity (too many tools/subscriptions).
    - Use capabilities to increase *output per hour* (templates, scripts, habits, checklists, delegating).
    - Prefer capabilities that transfer across life domains (communication improves work + family + community).
    - Periodically prune: drop low-ROI tools, skills, and commitments.


##### Capabilities

ID: HUMANITY.ELEMENTS.RESOURCES.CAPABILITIES
TAGS: [[HUMANITY:CAPABILITIES]] [[CAPABILITIES]]

Buildable multipliers that improve efficiency and effectiveness when using [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]] to perform [[HUMANITY:ACTIVITIES]] and meet [[HUMANITY:NEEDS]].
- **Autonomy**: *learnable ability* to [[HUMANITY:REGULATION]] (e.g., [[HUMANITY:MOTIVATORS]], [[HUMANITY:TEMPTATIONS]], [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]], [[HUMANITY:ACTIVITIES]]), setting priorities and governing self; *available degree of control and discretion* over [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]] and [[HUMANITY:ACTIVITIES]] of others and self (i.e., authority, freedom, power).
  - *Tips*
    - Heuristic: (Resources [Time + Energy + Integrity[Discipline]] + Capabilities[Experiences]) + (Capabilities[Relationships + Knowledge + Abilities + Tools + Finances] → Integrity → Autonomy
    - **Protect energy so decisions don’t feel impossible**: consistent sleep/movement/nutrition, reducing chronic drains, and matching tasks to your energy type lowers the “cost” of choosing and acting.
    - **Invest in integrity to reduce coordination overhead**: when self-trust and social trust are high, you need fewer “check-ins,” less rework, and fewer defensive cycles—making autonomy smoother to exercise.
    - **Strengthen relationships for support + opportunity**: supportive connections can provide help, accountability, and access to opportunities you can’t create alone (which expands your option set).
    - **Grow knowledge + skills to widen your choice-set**: more competence and accurate information expands what you can realistically do (work, negotiate, solve problems, navigate systems).
    - **Use tools + systems to reduce recurring effort**: tools “extend capability,” and systems like routines/checklists/meal planning reduce ongoing time costs—freeing discretionary time for self-directed choices.
    - **Build financial buffers to buy options**: emergency funds, lower debt burden, and “financial flexibility” can reduce forced choices and let you say “no,” switch jobs, move, get training, etc.
- **Abilities**: Baseline aptitudes (physical, cognitive, emotional).
  - *Tips*
    - Heuristic: (Time + Energy + Discipline + Experiences) + (Talents + Tools) + Mentors[Guidance + Accountability] + Finances → Health & Wellness → Abilities
    - Maintain health, practice, accommodations, realistic load.
    - Pick roles/tasks that reflect your strengths, your weaknesses, existing opportunities, and existing threats (i.e., risks).
      - Strengths + Opportunities = Leverage: Use strengths to maximize/seize opportunities.
      - Strengths + Threats = Defend: Use strengths to minimize/mitigate threats(i.e., risks).
      - Weaknesses + Opportunities = Collaborate: Partner with someone whose strengths are your weaknesses; use opportunities to overcome/minimize weaknesses;
      - Weaknesses + Threats = Avoid: minimize weaknesses and avoid threats (i.e., risks).
- **Relationships**: Connections with people who provide support, opportunity, belonging, accountability.
  - *Tips*
    - Heuristic: (Time + Energy + Integrity + Experiences) + (Relationships) → Mentors (5-7 diverse)
    - Heuristic: (Time + Energy + Integrity + Experiences) + (Relationships + Knowledge + Skills) → Relationships
    - Maintain reliability, reciprocity, shared time, conflict repair.
    - Ask early, ask clearly, and offer value; “weak ties” help opportunity, “strong ties” help resilience.
- **Experiences**: Lived repetitive experiences that build judgment and confidence.
  - *Tips*
    - Heuristic: (Time + Energy) + (Integrity[Discipline]) + (Relationships + Experiences) + Finances → Experiences
    - Reflect (what worked/failed), capture lessons, seek varied repetitive experiences.
    - Turn experience into patterns/playbooks; avoid repeating avoidable mistakes.
- **Knowledge**: Accurate information and understanding.
  - *Tips*
    - Heuristic: (Time + Energy + Integrity[Discipline] + Experiences) + (Mentors[Guidance + Accountability]) + (Skills + Tools + Finances + Knowledge) → Knowledge
    - Curate inputs; refresh what changes; verify important claims.
    - Apply in decisions; summarize into checklists/heuristics to reduce mental load.
- **Skills**: Trained, repeatable competencies (communication, writing, trades, coding, caregiving).
  - *Tips*
    - Heuristic: (Time + Energy + Integrity[Discipline] + Experiences) + (Mentors[Guidance + Accountability]) + (Knowledge + Skills + Tools + Finances) → Skills
    - Maintain deliberate practice + feedback; small weekly repetitions prevent decay.
    - Focus on the “20% skills” that drive 80% outcomes in your life (often communication, planning, and domain skill).
- **Tools**: Physical/digital aids that extend capability (devices, apps, vehicles, appliances) and capacity.
  - *Tips*
    - Heuristic: (Time + Energy + Integrity[Discipline] + Experiences) + (Knowledge + Skills + Tools + Finances) + (Mentors[Guidance + Accountability]) →  Tools
    - Keep them simple, secure, and functional (updates, backups, maintenance schedules).
    - Standardize and template; don’t let tool choice become procrastination.
- **Finances**: Money, credit, and financial flexibility that buffer shocks and buy time/options.
  - *Tips*
    - Heuristic: (Integrity[Discipline] + Relationships[Awareness + Sales + Collaboration + Supplies] + (Skills + Tools) + (Knowledge + Time + Energy) + (Finances) → Finances
    - Maintain spending plan, emergency fund, insurance coverage where appropriate, avoid high-interest spirals.
    - Buy back time (outsourcing key pain points), reduce stressors that drain energy, invest in high-ROI capability building (training, certifications, equipment).

### Elements


#### Fallibility

ID: HUMANITY.ELEMENTS.FALLIBILITY
TAGS: [[HUMANITY:FALLIBILITY]] [[FALLIBILITY]]

Humans are inherently limited and fallible—we have [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]], and we will sometimes miss commitments, make mistakes, or fall short. A healthier expectation is not “perfection,” but [[HUMANITY:HUMILITY]] (recognizing our limitations and being willing to acknowledge mistakes) and [[HUMANITY:INTEGRITY]] (keeping promises small enough to keep, and repairing quickly when we miss—acknowledge, make amends, and adjust the system). When another person makes a mistake, pause and practice [[HUMANITY:HUMILITY]] (remember I’m fallible too), [[HUMANITY:MERCY]] (respond with [[HUMANITY:COMPASSION]], not punishment), [[HUMANITY:GRATITUDE]] (notice their effort and intention), [[HUMANITY:HUMOR]] (keep things human plus defuse blame and shame), [[HUMANITY:FAIRNESS]] (judge with the same standard you’d want applied to you), and [[HUMANITY:LEADERSHIP]] (help repair, learn, and move forward—together).

##### Stereotypes

ID: HUMANITY.ELEMENTS.FALLIBILITY.STEREOTYPES
TAGS: [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] [[STEREOTYPES]]

**Stereotypes** are **generalized beliefs** about a group of people (e.g., “people from X are…”). They’re *cognitive* (thoughts) and can be positive, negative, or “neutral,” but they’re often oversimplified and inaccurate. Stereotypes distort expectations. As such, stereotypes are an example of our [[HUMANITY:FALLIBILITY]]. Stereotypes and [[HUMANITY:PREJUDICES]] are often a result of insufficient [[HUMANITY:PERSPECTIVE]] and [[HUMANITY:THINKING]]. Stereotypes usually emerge from [[HUMANITY:TEMPTATIONS]] (e.g., **Tribal Thinking**, **Social Comparison**, **Power and Control**). Stereotypes may be supported by  [[HUMANITY:TEMPTATIONS]]’s **Confirmation Bias**. [HUMANITY:CONSEQUENCES_TEMPTATIONS]] (e.g., **Moral and Ethical Compromise**, **Inflexibility and Rigidity**, **Selfishness**) may also help to reinforce stereotypes. A person could hold stereotypes and [[HUMANITY:PREJUDICES]] without acting on them (i.e., without discriminating). However, stereotypes (in partnership with the [[HUMANITY:PREJUDICES]] they inspire) generally create significant risk of harm to “those people” (others) and ourselves during [[HUMANITY:ORIENT]] by impairing our [[HUMANITY:PERSPECTIVE]], [[HUMANITY:THINKING]], [[HUMANITY:COMPASSION]], and ultimately our [[HUMANITY:INTERDEPENDENCE]]. [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] often contribute to the emergence of [[HUMANITY:PREJUDICES]]. [[HUMANITY:DISCRIMINATION]] often contributes to the emergence and reinforcement of [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] and [[HUMANITY:PREJUDICES]]. Stereotypes (in partnership with the [[HUMANITY:PREJUDICES]] they inspire) reduce our [[HUMANITY:MOTIVATORS]] and likelihood of using our [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]] and likelihood of performing [[HUMANITY:ACTIVITIES]] to help satisfy the [[HUMANITY:NEEDS]] of “those people”, thereby impairing their ability to avoid [[HUMANITY:CONSEQUENCES_UNMET_NEEDS]], while simultaneously limiting our [[HUMANITY:INTERDEPENDENCE]]. Stereotypes likely impair our consistent and efficient performance of our [[HUMANITY:MISSION]], which impairs our contributions to our [[HUMANITY:VISION]], thereby increasing risks and harms to the [[HUMANITY:RIGHTS]] of ourselves and others. Ultimately, stereotypes typically impair the intentional and consistent practice of many [[HUMANITY:VALUES]] (e.g., [[HUMANITY:THINKING]], [[HUMANITY:PERSPECTIVE]], [[HUMANITY:OPENNESS]], [[HUMANITY:CURIOSITY]], [[HUMANITY:LEARNING]], [[HUMANITY:LOVE]], [[HUMANITY:MERCY]], [[HUMANITY:REGULATION]], [[HUMANITY:PRUDENCE]], [[HUMANITY:HUMILITY]], [[HUMANITY:TEMPERANCE]], [[HUMANITY:HUMOR]], [[HUMANITY:GRATITUDE]], [[HUMANITY:PURPOSE]], [[HUMANITY:FAIRNESS]], [[HUMANITY:JUSTICE]], [[HUMANITY:CITIZENSHIP]], [[HUMANITY:LEADERSHIP]], [[HUMANITY:INTEGRITY]], [[HUMANITY:VITALITY]], [[HUMANITY:TRANSCENDENCE]], [[HUMANITY:COMPASSION]], [[HUMANITY:INTERDEPENDENCE]], [[HUMANITY:WISDOM]]).


##### Prejudices

ID: HUMANITY.ELEMENTS.FALLIBILITY.PREJUDICES
TAGS: [[HUMANITY:PREJUDICES]] [[PREJUDICES]]

**Prejudices** are **pre-judgments or attitudes** (usually negative) toward a person or group, often based on [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] rather than direct knowledge.  They’re *affective* (feelings/evaluations), such as dislike, fear, or distrust. Prejudices generally create significant risk of harm to “those people” (others) and ourselves during [[HUMANITY:ORIENT]] by impairing our [[HUMANITY:PERSPECTIVE]], [[HUMANITY:THINKING]], [[HUMANITY:COMPASSION]], and ultimately our [[HUMANITY:INTERDEPENDENCE]]. Prejudices reduce our [[HUMANITY:MOTIVATORS]] and likelihood of using our [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]] and likelihood of performing [[HUMANITY:ACTIVITIES]] to help satisfy the [[HUMANITY:NEEDS]] of “those people”, thereby impairing their ability to avoid [[HUMANITY:CONSEQUENCES_UNMET_NEEDS]], while simultaneously limiting our [[HUMANITY:INTERDEPENDENCE]]. [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] often contribute to the emergence of prejudices. Prejudices often lead to [[HUMANITY:DISCRIMINATION]]. However, a person could hold [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] and prejudices without acting on them (i.e., without discriminating). Prejudices impair the intentional inconsistent practice of many [[HUMANITY:VALUES]] (e.g., [[HUMANITY:THINKING]], [[HUMANITY:PERSPECTIVE]], [[HUMANITY:OPENNESS]], [[HUMANITY:CURIOSITY]], [[HUMANITY:LEARNING]], [[HUMANITY:LOVE]], [[HUMANITY:MERCY]], [[HUMANITY:REGULATION]], [[HUMANITY:PRUDENCE]], [[HUMANITY:HUMILITY]], [[HUMANITY:TEMPERANCE]], [[HUMANITY:HUMOR]], [[HUMANITY:GRATITUDE]], [[HUMANITY:PURPOSE]], [[HUMANITY:FAIRNESS]], [[HUMANITY:JUSTICE]], [[HUMANITY:CITIZENSHIP]], [[HUMANITY:LEADERSHIP]], [[HUMANITY:INTEGRITY]], [[HUMANITY:VITALITY]], [[HUMANITY:TRANSCENDENCE]], [[HUMANITY:COMPASSION]], [[HUMANITY:INTERDEPENDENCE]], [[HUMANITY:WISDOM]]). Prejudices impair our consistent and efficient performance of our [[HUMANITY:MISSION]], which impairs our contributions to our [[HUMANITY:VISION]], thereby increasing risks and harms to the [[HUMANITY:RIGHTS]] of ourselves and others. [[HUMANITY:DISCRIMINATION]] may help to reinforce prejudices. Prejudices are often a result of insufficient [[HUMANITY:PERSPECTIVE]] and [[HUMANITY:THINKING]]; examples of our [[HUMANITY:FALLIBILITY]]. [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] and prejudices usually emerge from and are reinforced by [[HUMANITY:TEMPTATIONS]] (e.g., **Social Comparison**, **Tribal Thinking**, **Power and Control**). [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] and prejudices may be supported by [[HUMANITY:TEMPTATIONS]]’s **Confirmation Bias**. [HUMANITY:CONSEQUENCES_TEMPTATIONS]] (e.g., **Moral and Ethical Compromise**, **Inflexibility and Rigidity**, **Selfishness**) may also help to reinforce [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] and prejudices.


##### Discrimination

ID: HUMANITY.ELEMENTS.FALLIBILITY.DISCRIMINATION
TAGS: [[HUMANITY:DISCRIMINATION]] [[DISCRIMINATION]]

**Discrimination** is **unequal treatment or unfair actions** toward people based on group membership (race, gender, religion, disability, etc.). It’s *behavioral* (what someone does) and can be individual (one person), institutional (policies/practices), or structural (system-wide patterns). [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] and [[HUMANITY:PREJUDICES]] affect [[HUMANITY:ORIENT]], which affects [[HUMANITY:DECIDE]], which results in discrimination during [[HUMANITY:ACT]]. Discrimination is a result of our examples of our [[HUMANITY:FALLIBILITY]]. The resulting discrimination creates real-world unequal outcomes and harms (e.g.,  [[HUMANITY:CONSEQUENCES_UNMET_NEEDS]], [HUMANITY:CONSEQUENCES_TEMPTATIONS]]). Discrimination may reinforce [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] and [[HUMANITY:PREJUDICES]] (e.g., treating a group unfairly can be used to “justify” biased beliefs). Discrimination does not require [[HUMANITY:STEREOTYPES]] or [[HUMANITY:PREJUDICES]]; someone might discriminate due to **rules/incentives/social pressure** even without strong personal [[HUMANITY:PREJUDICES]]. Discrimination is the likely reduction of using our [[HUMANITY:RESOURCES]] and likelihood of performing [[HUMANITY:ACTIVITIES]] to help satisfy the [[HUMANITY:NEEDS]] of “those people”, thereby impairing their ability to avoid [[HUMANITY:CONSEQUENCES_UNMET_NEEDS]], while simultaneously limiting our [[HUMANITY:INTERDEPENDENCE]]. Discrimination limits the intentional and consistent practice of many [[HUMANITY:VALUES]] (e.g., [[HUMANITY:THINKING]], [[HUMANITY:PERSPECTIVE]], [[HUMANITY:OPENNESS]], [[HUMANITY:CURIOSITY]], [[HUMANITY:LEARNING]], [[HUMANITY:LOVE]], [[HUMANITY:MERCY]], [[HUMANITY:REGULATION]], [[HUMANITY:PRUDENCE]], [[HUMANITY:HUMILITY]], [[HUMANITY:TEMPERANCE]], [[HUMANITY:HUMOR]], [[HUMANITY:GRATITUDE]], [[HUMANITY:PURPOSE]], [[HUMANITY:FAIRNESS]], [[HUMANITY:JUSTICE]], [[HUMANITY:CITIZENSHIP]], [[HUMANITY:LEADERSHIP]], [[HUMANITY:INTEGRITY]], [[HUMANITY:VITALITY]], [[HUMANITY:TRANSCENDENCE]], [[HUMANITY:COMPASSION]], [[HUMANITY:INTERDEPENDENCE]], [[HUMANITY:WISDOM]]). Discrimination limits consistent and efficient performance of our [[HUMANITY:MISSION]], which impairs our contributions to our [[HUMANITY:VISION]], thereby increasing risks and harms to the [[HUMANITY:RIGHTS]] of ourselves and others. [HUMANITY:CONSEQUENCES_TEMPTATIONS]] (e.g., **Selfishness**, **Moral and Ethical Compromise**, **Inflexibility and Rigidity**, **Exploitation and Manipulation**, **Aggression and Violence**) may also contribute to more frequent and more severe discrimination.
